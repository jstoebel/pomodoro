#Catadoro timer: a pomodoro timer, but cats!

This is a pomodoro timer implemented in Javascript. Set the amount of time you would like to work. The orange kitty will tell you when its time to take a break and when its time to get back to work. He will even suggest a nice distraction when its break time.
